Necessary / Essential CSS boilerplate with minimal opinions and a few extras.

### Need to know
Avoid the typical boilerplate, understand a few key concepts, then do your own thing.

* `box-sizing: border-box` is applied globally.
* Images are responsive by default: `img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }`.
* Grid systems are overrated. Use `flex-box` case-by-case and create helpers along the way.
